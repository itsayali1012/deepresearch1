# DeepResearch - AI Agent-Based Deep Research System

This is a **dual-agent AI system** designed to perform **deep web research** and **answer drafting** automatically.  
The system uses **Tavily API** for real-time information gathering, and **HuggingFace Transformers** for text summarization.  
The agent workflow is built with **LangGraph**, offering a lightweight, flexible graph-based orchestration.
